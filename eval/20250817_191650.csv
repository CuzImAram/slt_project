What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,The provided context snippets do not contain any information about the difference between a supernova and a hypernova.,"A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful explosion than a supernova, often associated with the collapse of a very massive star into a black hole and the emission of intense gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae are thought to be responsible for long-duration gamma-ray bursts, which are among the most energetic events in the universe. While both involve stellar explosions, hypernovae release significantly more energy and are linked to more extreme astrophysical conditions. Supernovae are more common, whereas hypernovae are rare and occur under specific, extreme circumstances.",Pipeline 4,3.3446455001831055,27.431849241256714,

How to tell if an egg is bad,"To tell if an egg is bad, place it in a bowl of water. If the egg floats, it is old and should be discarded. If it sinks and lies flat on its side, it is fresh. If it doesn't float but one side lifts, it is about 1 week old. If both sides lift, it is about 3 weeks old.","An egg is bad if it floats in water. When an egg floats, it indicates that the egg has gone bad and should not be consumed. Fresh eggs will sink to the bottom and lie flat, while older eggs may stand upright or float due to the increased air pocket inside.

What is the theory of plate tectonics?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about the theory of plate tectonics. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given text.","The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth's outer shell is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer in the upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and the formation of ocean basins. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. The theory unifies various geological observations, including the fit of continental coastlines, the distribution of fossils, and the alignment of mountain ranges and seismic activity. It is a foundational concept in modern geology.",Pipeline 4,4.772944450378418,14.232166528701782,

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later supported by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that increased levels of these gases could lead to global warming. The effect occurs because these gases trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). When demand increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when supply increases and demand remains constant, prices tend to fall. Taxes on producers, such as the gas tax, can reduce supply by cutting into profits, shifting the supply curve inward and increasing the equilibrium price. Price floors, like minimum wage, can also affect the labor market by setting a minimum price, potentially leading to unemployment if the wage is set above the equilibrium level.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
