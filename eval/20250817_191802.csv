What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about supernovae or hypernovae, nor do they discuss their differences. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context.","A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful explosion than a supernova, often associated with the collapse of extremely massive stars (typically over 25 solar masses) into black holes, and is frequently linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae release significantly more energy than supernovae and are thought to result from the formation of relativistic jets during the collapse. While both involve stellar explosions, hypernovae are rarer and more extreme events. The key difference lies in their energy output, progenitor stars, and associated phenomena like gamma-ray bursts.",Pipeline 4,4.662470579147339,26.428192853927612,A didn't have an answer

When placed in a bowl of water, if the egg rises to the surface and floats, it indicates that the egg is old and likely spoiled, so it should be discarded. If the egg sinks but one side lifts, it is about one week old; if both sides lift, it is around three weeks old. Fresh eggs will sink to the bottom and lie flat.

What are the most common rock types on earth,The provided context snippets do not contain information about the most common rock types on Earth.,"The most common rock types on Earth are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. Igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite, form from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava and are the most abundant in the Earth's crust. Sedimentary rocks, like sandstone and limestone, are formed from the accumulation and compaction of sediments and are widespread on the surface. Metamorphic rocks, such as marble and slate, result from the transformation of existing rocks under heat and pressure.

What is the theory of plate tectonics?,The provided context snippets do not contain information about the theory of plate tectonics.,"The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth's outer shell is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer in the upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and the formation of ocean basins. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. The theory unifies various geological observations, including the fit of continental coastlines, the distribution of fossils, and the alignment of mountain ranges and seismic activity.

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later supported by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that increased levels of these gases could lead to global warming. The effect occurs because these gases trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. When a tax is imposed, such as a sales tax, it shifts the supply curve inward, leading to a higher equilibrium price. Government actions like minimum wage laws affect the labor market by setting a price floor, which can influence employment levels and real wages. These principles apply to both goods and labor markets, where shifts in supply or demand alter market outcomes.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
