What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about supernovae or hypernovae, nor do they discuss their differences. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context.","A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful type of stellar explosion, often associated with the collapse of a very massive star into a black hole, and is linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae release significantly more energy than regular supernovae and are thought to result from the formation of relativistic jets during the collapse. While both involve the death of massive stars, hypernovae are rarer and more extreme in their energy output. Supernovae are classified into types (e.g., Type Ia, Type II), while hypernovae are considered a subset of the most energetic Type Ic supernovae.",Pipeline 4,3.762216091156006,17.839962244033813,Answer B failed entirely while A worked just fine

What is the theory of plate tectonics?,The provided context snippets do not contain information about the theory of plate tectonics.,"The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth's outer shell is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer in the upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and the formation of ocean basins. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. Plate tectonics accounts for the distribution of continents, oceans, and seismic activity across the globe.

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later strengthened by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that the presence of these gases could affect the Earth's climate and temperature. In the 19th century, scientists realized that atmospheric gases cause a greenhouse effect that influences the planet's temperature.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This was first demonstrated by John Tyndall in 1859, who discovered that carbon dioxide can absorb and retain heat. Svante Arrhenius later proposed in 1896 that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could lead to higher global temperatures. The effect was initially theorized by Joseph Fourier in 1824, who suggested that the Earth's atmosphere traps heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). When demand increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when supply increases and demand remains constant, prices tend to fall. Taxes on producers, such as the gas tax, can reduce supply by cutting into profits, shifting the supply curve inward and increasing the equilibrium price. Price floors, like minimum wage, can also affect the labor market by setting a minimum price, potentially leading to unemployment if the floor is above the equilibrium wage.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
