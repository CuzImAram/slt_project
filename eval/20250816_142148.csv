What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about supernovae or hypernovae, nor do they discuss their differences. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context.","A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful explosion than a supernova, often associated with the collapse of extremely massive stars (typically over 25 solar masses) into black holes, and is linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae release significantly more energy than regular supernovae and are thought to result from the formation of relativistic jets during the collapse. While both involve stellar explosions, hypernovae are rarer and more extreme in their energy output and physical mechanisms.",Pipeline 4,3.537767171859741,16.909075021743774,Satisfying answer to the question

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later supported by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that increased levels of these gases could lead to global warming. The effect occurs because these gases trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). When demand increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when supply increases and demand remains constant, prices tend to fall. Taxes on producers, such as the gas tax, can reduce supply by cutting into profits, shifting the supply curve inward and increasing the equilibrium price. Price floors, like minimum wage, can also affect the labor market by setting a minimum price, potentially leading to unemployment if the floor is above the equilibrium wage.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
