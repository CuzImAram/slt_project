What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about supernovae or hypernovae, nor do they discuss their differences. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context.","A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful explosion than a supernova, often associated with the collapse of extremely massive stars (typically over 25 solar masses) into black holes, and is linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae release significantly more energy than supernovae and are thought to result from the formation of relativistic jets during the collapse. While both involve stellar explosions, hypernovae are rarer and more extreme events. The key difference lies in their energy output, progenitor stars, and associated phenomena like gamma-ray bursts.",Pipeline 4,3.803753614425659,19.795100212097168,Only answer
What was the historical significance of the Magna Carta?,"The Magna Carta is historically significant because it restricted the powers of the crown and established important legal principles, such as the right to habeas corpus, which protects individuals from unlawful detention.

How to tell if an egg is bad,"To tell if an egg is bad, place it in a bowl of water. If the egg floats, it is old and should be discarded. If it sinks and lies flat on its side, it is fresh. If it doesnâ€™t float but one side lifts, it is about 1 week old. If both sides lift, it is about 3 weeks old.","An egg is bad if it floats in water. When placed in a bowl of water, if the egg rises to the surface and floats, it indicates that the egg is old and likely spoiled, so it should be discarded. If the egg sinks but tilts upward on one side, it is about one week old; if both sides lift, it is around three weeks old. Fresh eggs will sink to the bottom and lie flat.

What is the theory of plate tectonics?,The provided context snippets do not contain any information about the theory of plate tectonics.,"The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth's outer shell is divided into large, rigid plates that move slowly over the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer in the upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and the formation of ocean basins. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. Plate tectonics accounts for the distribution of continents, oceans, and seismic activity across the globe.

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later supported by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that increased levels of these gases could lead to global warming. The effect occurs because these gases trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). When demand increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when supply increases and demand remains constant, prices tend to fall. Taxes on producers, such as the gas tax, can reduce supply by cutting into profits, shifting the supply curve inward and increasing the equilibrium price. Price floors, like minimum wage, can also affect the labor market by setting a minimum price, potentially leading to unemployment if the floor is above the equilibrium wage.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
