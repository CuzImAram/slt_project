What is the difference between a supernova and a hypernova?,"The provided context snippets do not contain any information about supernovae or hypernovae, nor do they discuss their differences. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given context.","A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star, typically occurring at the end of its life cycle, either through the collapse of a massive star's core or the detonation of a white dwarf in a binary system. A hypernova is an even more energetic and powerful explosion than a supernova, often associated with the collapse of a very massive star into a black hole and frequently linked to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae release significantly more energy than standard supernovae and are thought to result from extreme stellar conditions, such as rapid rotation and high mass. While both involve stellar explosions, hypernovae are rarer and more violent, representing the most energetic events in the universe. The key difference lies in their energy output, mechanisms, and associated phenomena like gamma-ray bursts.",Pipeline 4,5.205435276031494,23.255717992782593,Answer B doesnt have a answer in the first place and for someone that isnt educated in this matter a seems plausable enough to be a good answer without fact-checking every detail
What was the historical significance of the Magna Carta?,"The Magna Carta is historically significant because it restricted the powers of the crown and established important legal principles, such as the right to habeas corpus, which protects individuals from unlawful detention.

What is the theory of plate tectonics?,The provided context snippets do not contain information about the theory of plate tectonics.,"The theory of plate tectonics explains that Earth's outer shell is divided into several large, rigid plates that move slowly over the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer in the upper mantle. These plates interact at their boundaries, leading to geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and the formation of oceanic trenches. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push.

How does the greenhouse effect work?,"The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat. This process was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, and later supported by scientists like John Tyndall, who discovered in 1859 that carbon dioxide can absorb heat. Svante Arrhenius further speculated in 1896 that increased levels of these gases could lead to global warming. The effect occurs because these gases trap heat radiated from the Earth's surface, preventing it from escaping into space, thereby warming the planet.","The greenhouse effect works when certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, absorb and hold heat.

Explain the basic principles of supply and demand.,"The basic principles of supply and demand involve the interaction between the availability of a product (supply) and the desire for that product (demand). When demand increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when supply increases and demand remains constant, prices tend to fall. Taxes on producers, such as the gas tax, can reduce profits and shift the supply curve inward, affecting the equilibrium price. Price floors, like minimum wage, can also impact the labor market by setting a minimum price, potentially leading to unemployment if the wage exceeds the equilibrium level.","The provided context snippets do not contain information about the basic principles of supply and demand.
